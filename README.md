Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
===========================================================

The features have been implemented in 2 separate files.
tweets_cleaned.py - Clean incoming tweets off unicode and escape sequences.
average_degree.py - Build a graph of hashtags that occured together in tweets in the past 60 seconds. Find its average degree.

The unit tests are written into unit_tests.py. Run it using "python unit_tests.py" after changing to its directory.

half_sample_tweets.txt, sample_tweets.txt & test_output.txt are files used for testing purposes.

run.sh file runs both the feature files in order.
